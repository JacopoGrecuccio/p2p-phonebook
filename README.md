# p2p-phonebook
A very first example of peers interacting in a netwrok for sharing their own phonebook's contacts


## Running the demostration

In three separate terminal windows or tabs launch the three peers examples provied
(Satoshi,Vitalik,Killer) by typing respectively

```
# Terminal window 1
bash run-satoshi.sh
```

```
# Terminal window 2
bash run-vitalik.sh
```

```
# Terminal window 3
bash run-killer.sh
```

Then play with the menu for looking-up for phone contacts on each client and
read carefully the message on their console for understanding the mechanism

Have fun :-)
